popen(3) is just a library function, which relies on fork(2) and pipe(2) to do the real work.

However pipe(2) can only create unidirectional pipes. To send the child process input, and also capture the output, you need to open two pipes.

If you want to capture the stderr too, that's possible, but then you'll need three pipes, and a select loop to arbitrate reads between the stdout and stderr streams.
